      "MEASURE DESCRIPTION": "The Elective Outpatient PCI cost measure is meant to apply to clinicians who perform Elective Outpatient PCIs for Medicare beneficiaries during the performance period. This surgical procedure is meant to place a coronary artery stent for heart disease in a non-emergent, outpatient setting. The measure evaluates a clinician's risk-adjusted cost for the episode group by averaging it across all episodes attributed to the clinician. The cost of each episode is the sum of the cost to Medicare for services performed by the attributed clinician and other health care providers over the length of the episode, or \"episode window.\" The cost measure is calculated by determining the risk-adjusted episode cost, averaged across all of a clinician's episodes during the performance period.",

Solo practitioners and groups are identified by their National Provider Identification (NPI) and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) combination. Specifically, the MSPB measure assesses the average spend for Medicare services performed by providers/groups per episode of care.

This surgical procedure is meant to alleviate symptoms of pain and difficulty walking associated with chronic limb ischemia and excludes those patients who require emergent revascularization for acute limb ischemia. The measure evaluates a clinician’s risk-adjusted cost for the episode group by averaging it across all episodes attributed to the clinician.
